This exercise is about using k-means and agglomerative clustering algorithm, to evaluate if the clusters find the correct category of each business.

## Tasks ##
1) Merge all the reviews of every business into one string
2) Make a vector for every business with tf-iddf vectorizer
3) Use k-means and agglomerative with different linkage
4) Print for every cluster the 10 most frequently occuring words
5) Measure precision, recall and f1-score for every cluster
6) Make a diagramm with SSE and  Silhouette Coefficient to evaluate the best cluster
